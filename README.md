This project reads in a csv file containing the businesses around the city of Melbourne, stores them in a K-Dimensional tree, in this case k = 2, since the 
coordinates given were only the x and y axes. The project specifications were also given in the 'assignment2.pdf'. 
In the 'assignment2-data' file, we have data sorted in different orders to test the performances of the KD tree.
